## About this comic

**Shirley Cruz** is a leading Costa Rican female soccer player with stellar experience on worldwide recognized teams such as France's PSG. However she came from both a poor family's background and a time where it wasn't well regarded for women to pursue a career in soccer, so she had to sneak in in many ingenious ways. This pilot comic plays around with the concept of Shirley as a little girl, getting her hair cut like a boy to get into the neighborhood's soccer team.
