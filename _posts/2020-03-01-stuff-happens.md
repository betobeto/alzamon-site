### Stuff happens... sometimes

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.


### The hidden cost of optimism

Why did you bring us here? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.

- Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
- I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
- Belligerent and numerous.
