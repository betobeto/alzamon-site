work_details:
    - Ink on paper, 2019
    - "La Ribambelle is another creation of <a href='https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/roba.htm' target='_blank'>Jean Roba</a>, one of my perennial artistic influences. Loosely based in the format of The Little Rascals or Our Gang, it is an international gathering of kids getting on lots of adventures from their vacant lot in the middle of town."
