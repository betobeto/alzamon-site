## Some words about this comic

On early 2016 I attended the [European comics festival at Angoulême, France](https://www.bdangouleme.com/) — a longtime dream of mine. Because I knew barely any other Costa Rican had been there, I thought about making a 4-page comic using my characters showing facts about Costa Rica in French as a giveaway. I think I printed about 50 copies or so. Once there I also realized I had still a long time to go before even being considered "publishable" by the editorial houses over there... but the worst attempt is the one that is never done, right?
